Recog
=====

Simple character recognition and learning with neural networks.

Recog is an online app that learns and recognises characters and symbols.
It uses neural networks to identify mouse-drawn characters.  You can easily
teach it to recognise new characters, or it can even teach itself.  The
program's accuracy improves as it learns your hand-writing (or mouse-drawing).

It is primarily an educational program.  Recog demonstrates the difference
between supervised and unsupervised learning.  It has been used to introduce
neural networks to students from grade one to the senior undergraduate level.
